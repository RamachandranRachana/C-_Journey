## Regex Example

- In this example I parse two files using System.IO.File class 
- From the first file I decipher the first part of the quote by looking for split in the input lines. 
  This hidden code means to split the line and return the split output[forth index].
- From the second filr using Regex class I look for patterns of digits of lenght of 2 or 3 , convert to int and retun the character value of it.
